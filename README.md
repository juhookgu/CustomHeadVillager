# VillagerCustomTradeCode
The command for Minecraft 1.17 will summon villager with custom trade, Mostly Custom Head from https://minecraft-heads.com/ (kinda copy-paste texture ID)
This command should be use by Command Block, a villager with custom trade will be summoned 1 block above the Command Block.

This project is my first time with Github. Goofy around, try to host the code to write it online.
I'm not meant to violated any rule or do something stupid. if you find anything wrong, please kindly notice me.
